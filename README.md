# DC_MOTOR
Firmware for an 8U CubeSat solar sail deployment using STM32. It controls a DC motor via encoder feedback and PID, supporting serial commands to adjust RPM, direction, and revolutions. Real-time data (RPM, power, mAh, time) is transmitted for monitoring, ensuring precise and reliable sail deployment.
